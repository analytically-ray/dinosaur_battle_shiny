## Notes and Lessons Learned
* Built using RStudio and ChatGPT to experiment with Vibe Coding on top of my 10-years experience using R.
* Vibe coding can create a vast majority of the code and helps to easily add features, but when certain specific errors or obstacles happen, ChatGPT seems to cycle through the same instructions that don't work. This is when human deduction and expertise are needed. Most of the time, the errors are minor issues that can be fixed by a fundamental understanding of R.
