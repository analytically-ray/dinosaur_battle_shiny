# Dinosaur Battle Shiny App
When R Shiny meets my young dinosaur-enthused stakeholder, we get this interactive dino-adventure and feature requests become roars and user acceptance testing involves stomping feet.


## About the App

The **Dinosaur Battle Royale app** allows users to simulate battles between different dinosaurs. It's designed to be an **interactive experience** for dinosaur enthusiasts.


## Features

* **Dinosaur Selection**: Choose from a variety of dinosaur species to pit against each other, including:
    * Allosaurus

## Notes and Lessons Learned
* Built using RStudio and ChatGPT to experiment with Vibe Coding on top of my 10-years experience using R.
* Vibe coding can create a vast majority of the code and helps to easily add features, but when specific errors or hurdles occur, ChatGPT seems to cycle through the same solutions that don't work. This is when human deduction and expertise are needed. Most of the time, the errors are minor issues that can be fixed by a fundamental understanding of R.
